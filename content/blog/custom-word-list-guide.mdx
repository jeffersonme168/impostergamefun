## Why Create Custom Word Lists?

Pre-made word lists are great, but custom lists take your party game to the next level:

✨ **Personal connection** - Inside jokes your group will love
🎯 **Perfect difficulty** - Tailored to your players' knowledge
🎨 **Unique themes** - Match any occasion or interest
💯 **Replayability** - Endless new content

---

## The Golden Rules of Word Selection

### Rule 1: Know Your Audience

**Consider**:
- Age range
- Shared experiences
- Cultural backgrounds
- Interest levels
- Sense of humor

**Example**: Office workers might love industry jargon, while family reunions work better with childhood memories.

### Rule 2: Balance Difficulty

Too easy = boring, Too hard = frustrating

**Sweet spot**: 70% of players should recognize the word, but describing it should still require thought.

### Rule 3: Descriptive Potential

Good words have multiple ways to describe them:
- **Pizza**: shape, toppings, where eaten, temperature, texture
- Bad word: **The**: limited descriptive options

### Rule 4: Avoid Overlapping Categories

Don't use "Apple" and "Fruit" in the same game - too confusing!

### Personal History
- High school teachers' names
- Childhood vacation spots
- Family traditions
- Wedding memories (for wedding parties)
- Company milestones (for corporate events)

- Memorable embarrassing moments
- Group's favorite memes

### Professional/Industry Specific
- Medical terms (for healthcare workers)
- Tech jargon (for developers)
- Legal terms (for lawyers)
- Kitchen equipment (for chefs)
- Teaching methods (for educators)

### Hobby & Interest Based

## Creating Undercover Word Pairs

### The Similarity Formula

Perfect pairs share 2-3 qualities but differ in 1-2 key aspects:

**Example**: Coffee vs Tea
- ✅ Both: Hot beverages, morning drinks, caffeine
- ❌ Different: Beans vs leaves, preparation method

### Easy Pairs Strategy

**Same category, obvious differences**:
- Dog / Cat
- Summer / Winter
- Pizza / Burger
- Car / Truck
- Basketball / Football

### Medium Pairs Strategy

**Same subcategory, subtle differences**:
- Cappuccino / Latte
- iPhone / Android
- Netflix / Hulu
- Football / Soccer
- Guitar / Bass

### Hard Pairs Strategy

**Near-identical with tiny distinctions**:
- Leopard / Cheetah
- Turtle / Tortoise
- Jam / Jelly
- Prawns / Shrimp
- Couch / Sofa

## Step-by-Step Creation Process

### Step 1: Brainstorm (15 minutes)

**Method**: Mind mapping

1. Choose a central theme
2. Branch out to subcategories
3. List 20-30 words per subcategory
4. Don't filter yet - quantity over quality

**Example for "Office Party"**:
- Central: Work Life
  - Branch 1: Office equipment → Printer, Scanner, Laptop, Mouse
  - Branch 2: Meetings → PowerPoint, Zoom, Conference Room
  - Branch 3: Coffee culture → Latte, Break Room, Monday

### Step 2: Filter & Test (10 minutes)

**Ask yourself**:
- [ ] Can players describe this without the word?
- [ ] Is it appropriate for the group?
- [ ] Does everyone know what this is?
- [ ] Does it fit the theme?

Remove any words that don't pass all checks.

### Step 3: Organize by Difficulty (5 minutes)

Create three tiers:
- **Tier 1 (Easy)**: Everyone knows, easy to describe
- **Tier 2 (Medium)**: Most know, requires thought
- **Tier 3 (Hard)**: Expert knowledge, tricky descriptions

### Step 4: Create Pairs (for Undercover mode) (15 minutes)

Match similar words within each tier:
- Write each word on a card
- Physically arrange similar ones together
- Test if descriptions could apply to both

### Step 5: Playtest (One full game)

**Monitor**:
- Are players struggling or breezing through?
- Which words get the best reactions?
- Any words nobody understands?
- Game duration (adjust word count accordingly)

## Theme Ideas & Examples

### Wedding Party Theme

**Guest categories**:
- Bride's side: Words related to bride's interests
- Groom's side: Words related to groom's interests
- Mixed words: Relationship milestones

**Sample words**:
- First date location
- Proposal place
- Wedding venue
- Honeymoon destination
- How they met
- Wedding cake flavor
- First dance song

### College Reunion Theme

**Categories**:
- Professors' names
- Campus locations
- Dorm names
- Popular hangout spots
- Class subjects
- School traditions
- Graduation year events

### Friend Group Theme

**Personalized content**:
- Group members' nicknames
- Favorite restaurants you visit

- Shared music/movie preferences
- Past trip locations

### Industry Conference Theme

**Professional vocabulary**:
- Industry buzzwords
- Company names (competitors)

---

## Advanced Techniques

### The "Nostalgia Factor"

Include words that trigger memories:
- "Remember when we..."
- Classic TV shows from childhood
- Old technology (Walkman, Floppy Disk)
- Discontinued products

**Why it works**: Emotional connection makes descriptions more animated and fun.

### The "Local Flavor" Method

Use location-specific content:
- Local restaurants
- Neighborhood landmarks
- City slang
- Regional foods
- Local sports teams
- Municipal trivia

### The "Progression" Approach

Create word sets that tell a story:
- **Theme**: Wedding planning
- Words: Proposal, Ring, Venue, Dress, Cake, Vows, Dance, Honeymoon

Players subconsciously follow the narrative, creating richer discussions.

### The "Opposite Day" Twist

Pair antonyms for comedy:
- Hot / Cold
- Fast / Slow
- Big / Small
- Love / Hate

Works great for the Mr. White mode where guessing is involved!
