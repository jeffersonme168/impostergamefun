## What is Undercover Mode?

Undercover mode is an advanced variation of the Imposter Word Game. Unlike the classic mode where the imposter has no word at all, in Undercover mode, the imposter receives a **word that is similar but different** from the civilians' word.

For example:
- Civilian word: **Apple**
- Undercover word: **Pear**

This makes the game more nuanced and thrilling, as the undercover player can describe their word legitimately, while civilians must detect subtle differences to identify them.

## Advanced Tips: Describing Similar Words

### For Civilian Players
- **Be specific but not too obvious**: Describe clearly enough for fellow civilians, but don't give the word away to the undercover
- **Watch reactions**: Notice who gives vague or inconsistent descriptions
- **Ask strategic questions**: Probe suspicious players with follow-up questions

### For Undercover Players
- **Listen first, speak later**: Try not to be the first person to describe
- **Use vague universals**: Find descriptions that could apply to both words
- **Reverse engineer**: Deduce the civilians' word from their descriptions and adjust your strategy
