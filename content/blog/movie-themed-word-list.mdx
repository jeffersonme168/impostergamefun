Choose well-known movies and characters that most players will recognize. Avoid obscure indie films unless your group are all cinema enthusiasts.

**Best categories**:
- Blockbuster movies from the last 20 years
- Disney/Pixar characters
- Superhero names
- Famous movie quotes

### For Undercover Mode

Pair similar movies or characters:
- **Inception** vs **Interstellar**
- **Iron Man** vs **Captain America**
- **Finding Nemo** vs **Finding Dory**
- **Star Wars** vs **Star Trek**

### For Mr. White Mode

Use movie genres or industry terms - Mr. White can make educated guesses based on how others describe visual elements, themes, or cultural impact.

## Pro Tips for Movie-Themed Games

### 1. Mix Old and New
Combine classic films with recent blockbusters to accommodate different age groups.

### 2. Consider Your Audience
- Family gathering? Stick to PG-rated movies
- Adults-only? Include R-rated classics
- Gen Z crowd? Focus on 2010s-2020s films

### 3. Use Franchises Wisely
